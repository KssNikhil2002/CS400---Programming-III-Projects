# CS400---Programming-III-Projects
This repository consists of all the projects and programs I have implemented as part of CS400 - Programming III at UW madison 

The projects were carried out in groups of 8 people which had 2 sub groups(Red and Blue) of 4 people each. As guidance for distributing the development work across team members, every member was assigned a specific role. Those roles were rotated for each of the projects. The most important goal of assigning responsibilities to team members was that the project work is distributed equally and fairly across members. 

The different roles are :
    - Data Wrangler 
    - Algorithm Engineer 
    - Backend Developer 
    - Frontend Developer 

The roles i was assigned for each project are:
    - Project 1 - Frontend Developer 
    - Project 2 - Backend Developer 
    - Project 3 - Algorithm Engineer 
    
For each project, I have provided all files that i have implemented as part of my roles responsibility and any supporting files(Code).
